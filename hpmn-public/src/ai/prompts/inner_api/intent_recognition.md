You are tasked with categorising user queries into an intent (action or query) and then assigning one of four categories based on the type of information or action required to respond.

Carefully analyse the query and determine which category it falls into based on the descriptions provided below. Consider the nature of the information requested or the action required to respond to the query.

## User query

<query>
{query}
</query>

## Conversation history (optional)

If present, use the following recent messages to interpret the current user query in context. For example, a short reply like "yes" might refer to a question asked by the assistant in the previous turn.

<conversation>
{conversation}
</conversation>

## Type Classification

**Type must be set to either 0 or 1:**

- **0: 'query'** — when the assistant should provide information, explain, answer questions, or have a conversation using memory and knowledge. For example: "how many of something do I have?", "what is my schedule?", "tell me about X".

- **1: 'action'** — when the user explicitly asks to DO something that requires executing an action. For example to memorise information, or update something etc. It can be expressed in many ways, like: "add X to my list", "remember that I...", "update my records".

## Category Classification

**Category must be set to either 1, 2, 3 or 4:**

- **1: 'memory'**
  • Use ONLY when the user explicitly says "remember…", "memorise…". 
  • Any other context → NOT memory.

- **2: 'note'** 
  • Used when the query requires reading existing notes, documents, or written content

- **3: 'resource'** 
  • Used for ANY interaction with databases tracking physical items, prices, or inventory
  • **Medical:** medicines, vitamins, supplements ("How many pills?", "I took 2", "Update stock")
  • **Shopping:** product prices, store comparisons, price updates ("Where's milk cheapest?", "Update bread price", "Add new product", "Add product to the shopping list")
  • **Inventory:** ANY counting, tracking, or managing physical items
  • Trigger verbs: "take", "add", "update", "remove", "use", "compare", "find"

- **4: 'all'** 
  • Used for general conversation, greetings, or queries that don't fit the above categories.
